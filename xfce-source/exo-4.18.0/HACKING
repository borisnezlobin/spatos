Bug tracking system
===================

libexo uses the bug tracking system at https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/exo/-/issues
hosted and maintained by the Xfce project.


Patches
=======

Please submit patches to the Xfce bug tracking system or to the
people listed in the AUTHORS file. Your patch should be in unified
diff format (the -u option to GNU diff).

Please and send a patch against a recent version of this package. Patches
against the Git master branch are most preferable. You can always
access the master branch from

  https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/exo


Feature requests
================

Please file feature requests to the Xfce bug tracking system
(https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/exo/-/issues) with a Severity of
enhancement. Make sure that your feature request wasn't reported
already before; requesting a feature several times won't increase
the chance that it gets added.


Coding Style
============

 - GNU coding conventions, with GLib-like extensions, mostly the same as GTK+.
 - Always expand tabs. This differs from the GNU suggestion, but is necessary!


Release process
