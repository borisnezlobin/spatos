# [TypeNameOfPlugin]
# Disabled:    Set to true to avoid loading the plugin. By default all
#              plugins are loaded.
# Priority:    Priority of the plugin if more plugins support the same
#              uri-scheme / mime-type combination.
# Locations:   ;-separated path list the plugin will be used in. If the
#              source file is not a child of one of the locations, the
#              plugin won't be used and another plugin with a lower
#              priority will be tried.
#              Absolute paths, environment variables, ~/ and ~username/
#              are allowed. Leave empty to allow all locations.
# Excludes:    ;-separated path list the plugin will not be used in.
#              Absolute paths, environment variables, ~/ and ~username/
#              are allowed. Leave empty to exclude nothing. Please note
#              that paths in Excludes precede those in Locations.
# MaxFileSize: Maximum size of the source file the plugin will still
#              try to generate a plugin for. The size is in bytes,
#              0 disables the check.

# External Thumbnailers
###

# Thumbnailers provided by .thumbnailer desktop files located in $XDG_DATA_HOME/thumbnailers/ and
# $XDG_DATA_DIRS/thumbnailers/
#
# They can handle any mime type, depending on the contents of each particular desktop file.
# Their priority is defined here globally and by default lower than that of all internal
# thumbnailers.
# These priorities should in any case remain different, otherwise there is no way to know in
# advance which of the internal or external thumbnailer will be prioritized in case of a mime type
# match.
#
# In case of several desktop files with the same name in the thumbnailer directories, the one
# placed in the highest priority directory override all the others.
#
# All the properties below can be overridden per desktop file, in the "X-Tumbler Settings" group,
# for example:
# [X-Tumbler Settings]
# Priority=4
# MaxFileSize=104857600
