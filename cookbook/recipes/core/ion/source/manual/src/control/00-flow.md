# Flow Control

As Ion features an imperative paradigm, the order that statements are evaluated and executed is
determined by various control flow keywords, such as `if`, `while`, `for`, `break`, and
`continue`. Ion's control flow logic is very similar to POSIX shells, but there are a few major
differences, such as that all blocks are ended with the `end` keyword; and the `do`/`then`
keywords aren't necessary.
