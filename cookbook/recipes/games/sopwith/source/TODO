To Do
-----

Bugs:

Code Cleanup: 
	Remove useless files: swutil.c
	Restructure display to be state based - avoids all the horrible crap
		with longjmp at the moment
	Remove the XOR'ing mess - just draw the entire screen each time.
		Computers are fast enough that we dont need to do this 
		any more :)
Network:
	Ability to abort server
	Network disconnect should bring you back to the title screen
		Also on failure to connect
	Keep sending even when we are waiting for data (up to a point of 
		course). Currently the network code wont send the next 
		movement until its received the next movement from the 
		other player. As a result any kind of lag will drastically 
		kill the game speed.	
	> 2 Players, Teams
	Extra game modes -- Capture the flag etc

Friendly buildings/tanks should shoot at enemy planes?
Teams (player + AI)?
Custom levels
High score table?
Safe base?
