## Important Places to Contribute

(Before starting to contribute you **must** read the [FAQ](https://www.redox-os.org/faq/) and the [Redox Book](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/))

You can contribute to the Redox documentation and code on these repositories:

(The order is based on difficulty, easy things first)

- [Website](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/website)
- [Book](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/book) - High-level documentation
- [Build System Configuration](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox) - Our main repository
- [Cookbook](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/cookbook) - Ports system
- [Orbital](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/orbital) - Display server and window manager
- [Package Manager](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/pkgutils)
- [relibc](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/relibc) - Redox C Library
- [Drivers](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/drivers) - Device daemons
- [Kernel](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/kernel)

### Skill Levels

If you aren't fluent in Rust:

- Write documentation
- Use and test Redox, fill issues for bugs or needed features (please verify the repository issues before)
- Web development on the website (we don't accept JavaScript code)
- Write unit tests (may require minimal knowledge of Rust)

If you are fluent in Rust, but not operating system Development:

- Improve the Orbital display server and window manager.
- Port programs written in Rust to Redox (in most cases you need to port crates, be aware of missing functions on relibc, porting without these functions will make patches dirty)
- Improve the program compatibility in relibc
- Improve the package manager
- Improve the [Ion](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/ion) shell

If you are fluent in Rust, and have experience with operating system development:

- Familiarize yourself with the repository and code
- Grep for `TODO`, `FIXME`, `BUG`, `UNOPTIMIZED`, `REWRITEME`, `DOCME`, and `PRETTYFYME` and fix the code you find
- Update old code to remove warnings
- Improve and optimize code, especially in the kernel
- Write device drivers

For those who want to contribute to the Redox GUI, our GUI strategy has recently changed.

- We are improving the [Orbital](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/orbital) display server and window manager, you can read more about it on [this](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox/-/issues/1430) tracking issue.
- Redox is in the process of adopting other Rust-written GUI toolkits, such as [Iced](https://iced.rs) and [Slint](https://slint-ui.com/). Please check out those projects if this is your area of interest.
- OrbTk is in maintenance mode, and its developers have moved to other projects such as the ones below. There is currently no Redox-specific GUI development underway.

## Tracking Issues Index

We use an index to track the development priorities, you can find them on [this](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox/-/issues/1384) page.

## Build System

You can find the Redox build system organization and commands on [this](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch08-06-build-system-reference.html) page.

## Developer FAQ

You can see the most common questions and problems on [this](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch09-07-developer-faq.html) page.

## Porting Software

You can read how to use the Cookbook recipe system to port applications on [this](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch09-03-porting-applications.html) page.

## Libraries and APIs

You can read [this](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch09-06-libraries-apis.html) page to learn about the libraries and APIs used in Redox.

## Development Tips

You can find important tips on [this](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch09-02-coding-and-building.html#development-tips) section.

## References

We maintain a list of wikis, articles and videos to learn Rust, OS development and computer science on [this](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch09-08-references.html) page.

If you are skilled there's a possibility that they could improve your knowledge in some way.

## Best Practices and Guidelines

You can read the best practices and guidelines on [this](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch11-00-best-practices.html) chapter.

## Style Guidelines

### Rust

Since **Rust** is a relatively small and new language compared to others like C and C++, there's really only one standard. Just follow the official Rust standards for formatting, and maybe run `rustfmt` on your changes, until we setup the CI system to do it automatically.

### Git

Please follow our [Git style](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch12-04-creating-proper-pull-requests.html) for pull requests.

## GitLab

### Issues

To know how to create issues on the Redox GitLab, read [this](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch12-05-filing-issues.html) page.

### Pull Requests

Please follow [our process](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch12-04-creating-proper-pull-requests.html) for creating proper pull requests.

## Other Ways to Contribute

If you aren't good on coding, but you still want to help keep the project going, you can contribute and support in a variety of ways! We'll try to find a way to use anything you have to offer. 

### Design

If you're a good designer, whether it's 2D graphics, 3D graphics, interfaces, web design, you can help. We need logos, UI design, UI skins, app icons, desktop backgrounds, etc.

- [Redox backgrounds](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/backgrounds) - You can send your wallpapers on this repository.
- [Redox assets](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/assets) - You can send your logos, icons and themes on this repository.

If you have questions about the graphic design, ask us on the [Chat](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch13-01-chat.html).
